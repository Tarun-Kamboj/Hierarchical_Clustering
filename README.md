Hierarchical clustering starts by treating each observation as a separate cluster. Then, it repeatedly executes the following two steps: <br>
  (1) identify the two clusters that are closest together, and <br>
  (2) merge the two most similar clusters. <br>
This iterative process continues until all the clusters are merged together, forming an hierarchical structure as shown below.
